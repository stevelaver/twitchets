A tool to watch for chosen event ticket listings on [Twickets](https://www.twickets.live) that match custom filters and send notifications to help you snap them up quickly!

**Why twitchets?**

I built this tool because the official Twickets app has limitations on the number of tracked events and lacks many features/filters I wanted and needed.

**Note**: This program does **not** buy tickets, reserve them automatically, or do anything unethical. It simply notifies you of new ticket listings!

Powered by [twigots](https://github.com/ahobsonsayers/twigots), a package to retrieve and filter Twickets ticket listings.

## Features

- No limit on the number of events you can watch for!
- On watch for tickets with a certain discount, number of tickets, and location
- Show more details in the notifications, such as event date/time, number of tickets, and discount
- Faster notifications than the official Twickets app
- No need to have the Twickets app or an account
- Choose from various notification services (Telegram, Ntfy, Gotify currently supported)

## Getting an API Key

To use this tool, you will need a Twickets API key. Although Twickets doesn't provide a free API, you can easily obtain a key by following these steps:

1.  Visit the [Twickets Live Feed](https://www.twickets.live/app/catalog/browse)
2.  Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and navigate to the Network tab
3.  Look for the GET request to `https://www.twickets.live/services/catalogue` and copy the `api_key` query parameter

This API key is not provided here due to liability concerns, but it appears to be a fixed, unchanging value.

## Running

The best way to run twitchets is using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name twitchets \
    -v <path to config>:/twitchets/config.yaml
    --restart unless-stopped \
    arranhs/twitchets:latest
```

Or, use Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  twitchets:
    container_name: twitchets
    image: arranhs/twitchets:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - <path to config>:/twitchets
```

## Configuration

twitchets looks for a `config.yaml` file in your current working directory and fails to start if it's not found.

The configuration file structure can be seen in [`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml) or below:

```yaml
apiKey: <your twickets api key> # REQUIRED: See README.md for details on how to obtain.

country: GB # Currently only GB is supported

# Configure your notification services.
# Delete the ones you do not need.
notification:
  ntfy:
    url: <your ntfy url>
    topic: <your ntfy topic>
    username: <your ntfy username>
    password: <your ntfypassword>
  telegram:
    token: <your telegram api token>
    chatId: <your telegram chat id>
  gotify:
    url: <your gotify url>
    token: <your gotify api token>

# Global configuration that applies to all tickets.
# These can be overridden on a ticket-by-ticket basis (see below).
# The below are examples of all global configuration settings.
# Remove the settings you do not need.
global:
  # Regions which ticket listings must be in.
  # Defaults to all regions if not set.
  # Full list of regions can be seen here:
  # https://github.com/ahobsonsayers/twigots/blob/main/location.go#L79-L90
  regions:
    - GBLO # Only look for tickets in London

  # How similar the event name in the ticket listing must be to the one you specified.
  # Defaults to 0.85 if not set, allowing for naming inconsistencies.  # Between 0-1
  # Between 0-1
  eventSimilarity: 0.85

  # How many tickets must be in the listing.
  # Defaults to any number of tickets if not set.
  numTickets: 2

  # Minimum discount (including fees) of the tickets in the listing against the original price.
  # Defaults to any discount if not set.
  discount: 15

  # Notification services to send found ticket listings to.
  # Defaults to all configured services above.
  notification:
    - ntfy

# Ticket configuration.
# Settings set here take priority over global settings.
# If a setting is not set/specified here, the global setting will be used.
# To unset a global setting and use the default, set it to a negative value or an empty list, depending on the type.
# The below are examples. Tweak them as needed.
tickets:
  # Look for Lion King tickets using the global configuration.
  # For global configuration settings not set, defaults will be used.
  - event: Lion King # REQUIRED

  # Look for Taylor Swift tickets, overriding the global configuration.
  - event: Taylor Swift # REQUIRED

    # Override global configuration setting.
    # Event name must be an exact match.
    # For example, this will NOT match "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour".
    eventSimilarity: 1

    # Override global configuration setting.
    # Reset to default - watch for tickets from any region.
    regions: []

    # Override global configuration setting.
    # Reset to default - watch for tickets with any discount.
    numTickets: -1

    # Override global configuration setting.
    # Reset to default - watch for tickets with any discount.
    discount: -1

    # Override global configuration setting:
    # Send notifications to Telegram (instead of ntfy).
    notification:
      - telegram

  # Look for Oasis tickets (mostly) using the global configuration.
  # Notifications will be sent to all configured notification services.
  - event: Oasis # REQUIRED
    notification: []
```

## Why the name twitchets?

Because I feel like sometimes you need to have twitch like reactions to snap up tickets on Twickets before someone else gets them - which this tool helps you do. Therefore the mangling together of **twitch** and **Twickets** seemed fun and appropriate.
