A tool to watch for chosen event ticket listings on [Twickets](https://www.twickets.live) that match custom filters and notify you so you can quickly snap them up!

**Why twitchets?**

I built this tool because the official Twickets app has limitations on the number of events you can watch for tickets, and lacks many features/filters I wanted and needed.

**Note**: This program does **not** buy tickets, reserve them automatically, or do anything unethical. It simply notifies you of new ticket listings!

Powered by [twigots](https://github.com/ahobsonsayers/twigots), a Go package to fetch and filter event ticket listings from Twickets üéüÔ∏è

## Features

- No limit on the number of events you can watch for!
- Watch for tickets with a certain discount, number of tickets, and location
- Show more details in the notifications, such as event date/time, number of tickets, and discount
- Faster notifications than the official Twickets app
- No need to have the Twickets app or an account
- Choose from various notification services (Telegram, Ntfy, Gotify, SQS currently supported)

## Getting an API Key

To use this tool, you will need a Twickets API key. Although Twickets doesn't provide a free API, you can easily obtain a key by following these steps:

1. Visit the [Twickets Live Feed](https://www.twickets.live/app/catalog/browse)
2. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and navigate to the Network tab
3. Look for the GET request to `https://www.twickets.live/services/catalogue` and copy the `api_key` query parameter. You might need to refresh the page first if nothing appears in this tab.

This API key is not provided here due to liability concerns, but it appears to be a fixed, unchanging value.

## Installation & Running

The recommended way to run twitchets is using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name twitchets \
    -v <path to config>:/twitchets/config.yaml \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    arranhs/twitchets:latest

# Specify a custom config path with a flag or env var
docker run -d \
    --name twitchets \
    -v <path to config>:/data/my-config.yaml \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    arranhs/twitchets:latest --config /data/my-config.yaml

# Or using the TWITCHETS_CONFIG environment variable
docker run -d \
    --name twitchets \
    -v <path to config>:/data/my-config.yaml \
    -e TWITCHETS_CONFIG=/data/my-config.yaml \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    arranhs/twitchets:latest
```

Or, use Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  twitchets:
    container_name: twitchets
    image: arranhs/twitchets:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - <path to config>:/twitchets
```

## Configuration

By default twitchets looks for a `config.yaml` file in the current working directory.
Use the `--config` flag or `TWITCHETS_CONFIG` environment variable to specify a different location.

The configuration file structure can be seen in [`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml) or below:

## How does the event name matching/similarity work?

You can see more about how this works in the [twigots readme here](https://github.com/ahobsonsayers/twigots#how-does-the-event-name-matchingsimilarity-work).

## Why the name twitchets?

Because I feel like sometimes you need to have twitch-like reactions to snap up tickets on Twickets before someone else gets them - which this tool helps you do. Therefore the mangling together of **twitch** and **Twickets** seemed fun and appropriate.
